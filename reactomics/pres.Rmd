## Current Workflow for Untargeted Analysis

- Predefined rules between peaks/features and compounds

- Generate pseudo-spectrum

- Search database or *in silico* prediction to identify compounds

- Build the links between compounds by pathway/network analysis

> Features -> Compounds -> Relationship among compounds

- Problems

    - Time consuming - too many peaks
    - Sensitivity - DDA or MS/MS
    - Standards coverage

---

## My Idea

> Features -> Compounds -> Relationship among compounds

- You ACTUALLY don't need people (compounds) name to know their relationship

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte%2C_Georges_Seurat%2C_1884.jpg')
```

From [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte,_Georges_Seurat,_1884.jpg):A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat

???
- all compounds from metabolomcis study is a snapshot with metabolites and parent compounds
- We could find the relationship among people without know the name of each person
- mass spec could measure the distance without known the name of compounds

---

## My Idea

> Features -> ~~Compounds~~ -> Relationship among compounds

- Mass spectrum could directly measure reactions

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/srda.png')
```

???
- Annotation is not really necessary for certain scientific problem
- Relationship among compounds or reaction matters

---
## Why Reactions?

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/database.png')
```

- Numbers: Gene(5) < Protein(20+2) < Metabolite(100K) < Compound(100M)

- Combination: Gene(25000) < Protein(10K-1B) < Compound(???) 

- Small molecular **combination** is chemical reaction or paired mass distance

---

## Why PMD?

- [Nuclear Binding Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy)

$$\Delta m = Zm_{H} + Nm_{n} - M$$
- The missing mass was converted into energy ( $E=mc^2$ ) and emitted when the atom made

- Atoms -> Compounds -> Mass distances between compounds

- **Paired Mass Distances(PMD)** is unique

- **High resolution** mass spectrometry WINs

???
- Mass defects could be transferred from atom to paired mass distance
- HRMS could measure PMDs for qualitative analysis

---

## Sources of PMDs in the real data

- Reaction during sample preparation

  - Method evaluation

- In source reactions during the MS analysis

  - Redundant peaks
  - MS/MS analysis
  
- Biological reactions of compounds in the samples

  - Biomarker reaction
  - Metabolites of certain compounds
  - Reaction network

---

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### Reaction PMD

- Reaction: $P_1 + P_2 + … + P_n = C_1 + C_2 + … + C_m \ (n>=1,m>=1)$

- PMD matrix

```{r render= 'asis'}
C1 <- c('\\(|P_1 - C_1|\\)','\\(|P_2 - C_1|\\)','...','\\(|P_n - C_1|\\)')
C2 <- c('\\(|P_1 - C_2|\\)','\\(|P_2 - C_2|\\)','...','\\(|P_n - C_2|\\)')
C3 <- c('...','...','...','...')
Cm <- c('\\(|P_1 - C_m|\\)','\\(|P_2 - C_m|\\)','...','\\(|P_n - C_m|\\)')

tb <- rbind.data.frame(C1,C2,C3,Cm)
colnames(tb) <- c('\\(P_1\\)','\\(P_2\\)','...','\\(P_n\\)')
rownames(tb) <- c('\\(C_1\\)','\\(C_2\\)','...','\\(C_m\\)')
tb <- knitr::kable(tb, align="c",format = 'html',row.names = T,escape = F)
tb <- gsub("`", "", tb) 
tb
```

- Paired mass distances for certain parent compound:

$$PMD_{P_{k}} = min(|P_k-C_1|,|P_k-C_2|,...,|P_k-C_m|) (1 \le k \le n )$$
- Paired mass distances for certain reaction:

$$PMD_R = \{PMD_{P_{1}}, PMD_{P_{2}},...,PMD_{P_{n}}\}$$

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### KEGG reaction database

```{r}
library(pmd)
top10 <- table(omics$pmd2)[order(table(omics$pmd2),decreasing = T)][1:10]
example <- c('NAD(+) + succinate <=> fumarate + H(+) + NADH', 'NAD(+) + propanoyl-CoA <=> acryloyl-CoA + H(+) + NADH', 'ATP + GDP <=> ADP + GTP', 'deoxynogalonate + O2 <=> H(+) + H2O + nogalonate', 'H2O + hypotaurine + NAD(+) <=> H(+) + NADH + taurine', 'ATP + H2O <=> ADP + H(+) + phosphate','acetyl-CoA + propanoate <=> acetate + propanoyl-CoA', 'L-glutamate <=> D-glutamate','H2O + lactose <=> D-galactose + D-glucose','L-serine <=> 2-aminoprop-2-enoate + H2O')
react <- cbind.data.frame(pmd = top10,example)
colnames(react) <- c('PMD','Freq','Example')
knitr::kable(react,align = 'c',format = 'markdown')
```

- Real reactions contain ions
- Skewed by known reactions

---

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### HMDB compounds database

```{r}
library(pmd)
top10 <- head(hmdb,10)
knitr::kable(top10[,c(1,2,3)],align = 'c',format = 'markdown')
```

- Donimated by C, H and O
- Structure or reaction?

???
- We need quantitative mass ready database for PMD annotation

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### Response factor matters

- In one reaction, two compounds will show different response factors
- To evaluate if one reaction active or not, we need intensity ratio stable

- For example, [A,B], [C,D] and [E,F] are involved in the same PMD:

```{r}
GroupI <- c(100,50,'2:1',100,50,'2:1', 30,40, '3:4')
GroupII <- c(1000,500,'2:1',10,95,'2:19',120,160,'3:4' )
df <- rbind.data.frame(GroupI,GroupII)
colnames(df) <- c('A','B','RF ratio','C','D','RF ratio','E','F','RF ratio')
knitr::kable(df,align = 'c',format = 'markdown')
```

- [A,B] and [E,F] could be used for Quantitative analysis for certain PMD, rsd cutoff 30%
- [C,D] could be used to check dynamics of specific reaction

???
- Response factor is the slope of calibration curve for certain compound
- Total intensity of all pairs with the same PMD
- Count once for ions involved in multiple reactions

```
]

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 1

### Retention time cluster analysis

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
library(rmwf)
data(mzrt)
mzrtm <- enviGCMS::getdoe(mzrt)
gm <- mzrtm$groupmean
gr <- mzrtm$grouprsd
# filter data
srm <- grepl('NIST',colnames(gm))
blk <- grepl('Matrix',colnames(gm))
indexmean <- apply(gm,1,function(x) all(x[srm]>= 3*x[blk]))
mzrtfilter <- enviGCMS::getfilter(mzrt,rowindex = indexmean)
mzrtnist <- enviGCMS::getfilter(mzrt,rowindex = indexmean,colindex = grepl('NIST',colnames(mzrt$data)))
pmd <- pmd::getpaired(mzrt)
pmd::plotrtg(pmd)
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 2

### High frequency PMD analysis across RT clusters

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
pmd::plotpaired(pmd)
```

---

## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 2

### High frequency PMD analysis across RT clusters - example

- Based on data itself, those adducts/multiply charged ions/neutral loss/isotopologues can be unknown

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "300px"}
index <- pmd$paired$diff2 == 21.98
pmd::plotpaired(pmd,index)
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 3

### Independent peaks selection

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "430px"}
std <- pmd::getstd(pmd)
pmd::plotstd(std)
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 3

### Independent peaks selection - example

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "450px"}
par(mfrow = c(2,3))
pmd::plotstdrt(std,rtcluster = 46,main = 'Retention time group 46')
pmd::plotstdrt(std,rtcluster = 31,main = 'Retention time group 31')
pmd::plotstdrt(std,rtcluster = 40,main = 'Retention time group 40')
pmd::plotstdrt(std,rtcluster = 100,main = 'Retention time group 100')
pmd::plotstdrt(std,rtcluster = 49,main = 'Retention time group 49')
pmd::plotstdrt(std,rtcluster = 8,main = 'Retention time group 8')
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 3

### Why redundant?

- ~14.3% peaks can capture similar variances of all peaks
- For CAMERA/RAMclust, peaks with highest intensity from pcgroup were selected as independent peaks

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/software.png')
```

???
- Similar to isotope labeled results (5% peaks)
- Untargeted analysis does not mean big data

---

# Target compounds validation

```{r echo=F}
pmd <- c(985,18)
CAMERA <- c(1297,15)
RAMclust <- c(461,12)
profinder <- c(6628,7)
comp <- rbind.data.frame(pmd,CAMERA,RAMclust,profinder)
colnames(comp) <- c('Independent peaks','Target compounds found')
rownames(comp) <- c('pmd','CAMERA','RAMclust','profinder')
knitr::kable(comp, format = 'html')
```

- 103 compounds for validation
- 36 compounds could be found by xcms 6885 features
- 7 could be found by profinder untargeted analysis 6628 features

---

## Untargeted MS/MS analysis - PMDDA(unpublished)

### Sensitivity matters

- Target analysis could capture peaks with low intensity

- Untargeted analysis would loss sensitivity to capture all peaks 

- Send unknown while independent peaks for MS/MS

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/missxcms.png')
```


---
## Untargeted MS/MS analysis - PMDDA(unpublished)

- Only use GlobalStd peaks for MS/MS analysis
    - Multiple injections

- MS/MS spectral library annotation on [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu)

- Compare with Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) (173 compounds)
    - Annotated 235 extra compounds and overlap 59 compounds
    - Less contaminant ions
