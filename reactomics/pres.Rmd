## Current Workflow for Nontarget Analysis

- Predefined rules between peaks/features and compounds

- Generate pseudo-spectrum

- Search database or *in silico* prediction to identify compounds

- Build the links between compounds by pathway/network analysis

> Features -> Compounds -> Relationship among compounds

- Problems

    - Predefined rules about adducts, neutral loss
    - Standards for unknown compounds
    - Standards coverage

---

## My Idea

> Features -> Compounds -> Relationship among compounds

- You ACTUALLY don't need people (compounds) name to know their relationship

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte%2C_Georges_Seurat%2C_1884.jpg')
```

From [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte,_Georges_Seurat,_1884.jpg):A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat

???
- all compounds from metabolomcis study is a snapshot with metabolites and parent compounds
- We could find the relationship among people without know the name of each person
- mass spec could measure the distance without known the name of compounds

---

## My Idea

> Features -> ~~Compounds~~ -> Relationship among compounds

- Mass spectrum could directly measure reactions

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/srda.png')
```

???
- Annotation is not really necessary for certain scientific problem
- Relationship among compounds or reaction matters

---
## Why Reactions?

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/database.png')
```

- Numbers: Gene(5) < Protein(20+2) < Metabolite(100K) < Compound(100M)

- Combination: Gene(25000) < Protein(10K-1B) < Compound(???) 

- Small molecular's **combination** is chemical reaction or paired mass distance

---

## Why PMD?

- [Nuclear Binding Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy)

$$\Delta m = Zm_{H} + Nm_{n} - M$$
- The missing mass was converted into energy ( $E=mc^2$ ) and emitted when the atom made

- Atoms -> Compounds -> Mass distances between compounds

- **Paired Mass Distances(PMD)** is unique

- **High resolution** mass spectrometry WINs

???
- Mass defects could be transfered from atom to paired mass distance
- HRMS could measure PMDs for qualitative analysis

---

## Sources of PMDs in the real data

- Reaction during sample preparation

  - Method evaluation

- In source reactions during the MS analysis

  - Reduncdent peaks
  - MS/MS analysis
  
- Biological reactions of compounds in the samples

  - Biomarker reaction
  - Metabolites of certain compounds
  - Reaction network
  - Evolution

---

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### KEGG reaction database

```{r}
library(pmd)
top10 <- table(omics$pmd2)[order(table(omics$pmd2),decreasing = T)][1:10]
example <- c('NAD(+) + succinate <=> fumarate + H(+) + NADH', 'NAD(+) + propanoyl-CoA <=> acryloyl-CoA + H(+) + NADH', 'ATP + GDP <=> ADP + GTP', 'deoxynogalonate + O2 <=> H(+) + H2O + nogalonate', 'H2O + hypotaurine + NAD(+) <=> H(+) + NADH + taurine', 'ATP + H2O <=> ADP + H(+) + phosphate','acetyl-CoA + propanoate <=> acetate + propanoyl-CoA', 'L-glutamate <=> D-glutamate','H2O + lactose <=> D-galactose + D-glucose','L-serine <=> 2-aminoprop-2-enoate + H2O')
react <- cbind.data.frame(pmd = top10,example)
colnames(react) <- c('PMD','Freq','Example')
knitr::kable(react,align = 'c',format = 'markdown')
```

- Real reactions contain ions
- Skewed by known reactions

---

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### HMDB compounds database

```{r}
library(pmd)
top10 <- head(hmdb,10)
knitr::kable(top10[,c(1,2,3)],align = 'c',format = 'markdown')
```

- Donimated by C, H and O
- Structure or reaction?

???
- We need quantitative mass ready database for PMD annotation

---

## Quantitative and Qualitative analysis for Reaction

### Response factor matters

- In one reaction, two compounds will show different response factors
- To evaluate if one reaction active or not, we need intensity ratio stable

- For example, [A,B], [C,D] and [E,F] are involoved in the same PMD:

```{r}
GroupI <- c(100,50,'2:1',100,50,'2:1', 30,40, '3:4')
GroupII <- c(1000,500,'2:1',10,95,'2:19',120,160,'3:4' )
df <- rbind.data.frame(GroupI,GroupII)
colnames(df) <- c('A','B','RF ratio','C','D','RF ratio','E','F','RF ratio')
knitr::kable(df,align = 'c',format = 'markdown')
```

- [A,B] and [E,F] could be used for Quantitative analysis for certain PMD, rsd cutoff 30%
- [C,D] could be used to check dynamics of specific reaction

???
- Response factor is the slope of calibration curve for certain compound
- Total intensity of all pairs with the same PMD
- Count once for ions involved in multiple reactions

```

.half[
```{r ref1,results = 'asis'}
doi <- c('10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02380')
cat(unlist(rcrossref::cr_cn(dois = doi, format = "text", style = 'apa')))
```
]

---

## Gap between features and compounds

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

---

## GlobalStd Algorithm

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/GlobalStd.png')
```

.half[
```{r ref2,results = 'asis'}
doi <- c('10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.062')
cat(unlist(rcrossref::cr_cn(dois = doi, format = "text", style = 'apa')))
```
]

## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 1

### Retention time cluster analysis

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/pmd/articles/globalstd_files/figure-html/rtg-1.png')
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 2

### High freqency PMD analysis across RT clusters

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/pmd/articles/globalstd_files/figure-html/pmd-1.png')
```

---

## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 2

### High freqency PMD analysis across RT clusters - example

- Based on data itself, those adducts/multi-chargers/neutral loss/isotopologues can be unknown

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/pmd/articles/globalstd_files/figure-html/pmdindex-2.png')
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 3

### Independant peaks selection

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/pmd/articles/globalstd_files/figure-html/stdplot-1.png')
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 3

### Independant peaks selection - example

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/pmd/articles/globalstd_files/figure-html/stdrtplot-1.png')
```

---
## GlobalStd Algorithm Step 3

### Why redundant?

- ~20% peaks can capture similar variances of all peaks

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/pmd/articles/globalstd_files/figure-html/pca-1.png')
```

???
- Similiar to isotope labeled results (5% peaks)
- Untarget analysis does not mean big data

---
## Untargeted MS/MS analysis - PMDDA(unpublished)

- Only use GlobalStd peaks for MS/MS analysis
    - Multiple injections
- Compare with DDA annotation (173 compounds)
    - Annotated 235 extra compounds and overlap 59 compounds
    - Background clean

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/rpppmdda.png')
```
???
- GNPS MS/MS annotation
- 235:59:114 PMDDS:overlap:DDA
