## About Me

- Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences from Chinese Academy of Sciences

- Two years PostDoc training in Analytical Chemistry in University of Waterloo, Canada

- Work with Prof. Lauren Petrick since Sep. 2018

- Maintainter and author of 3 CRAN packages ([rgabriel](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgabriel/index.html), [enviGCMS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/enviGCMS/index.html), [pmd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pmd/index.html)) and contributor of [rticles](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rticles/index.html) package

- Research interests

    - environmental process of POPs
    - *in vivo* SPME
    - metabolomics data analysis
    - reproducible research

## Current Workflow for Nontarget Analysis

- Predefined rules between peaks/features and compounds

- Generate pseudo-spectrum

- Search database or *in silico* prediction to identify compounds

- Build the links between compounds by pathway/network analysis

> Features -> Compounds -> Relationship among compounds

- Problems

    - Standards for unknown compounds
    - Standards coverage

---

## My Idea

> Features -> ~~Compounds~~ -> Relationship among compounds

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte%2C_Georges_Seurat%2C_1884.jpg')
```

From [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte,_Georges_Seurat,_1884.jpg):A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat

???
- all compounds from metabolomcis study is a snapshot with metabolites and parent compounds
- We could find the relationship among people without know the name of each person
- mass spec could measure the distance without known the name of compounds

---

## My Idea

> Features -> ~~Compounds~~ -> Relationship among compounds

- Mass spectrum could directly measure reactions

- Biomarker **reactions**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/srda.png')
```

???
- Annotation is not really necessary for certain scientific problem
- Relationship among compounds or reaction matters

---

## Results

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/toc.png')
```

```{r pmdref,results = 'asis'}
doi <- c('10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.062')
cat(unlist(rcrossref::cr_cn(dois = doi, format = "text", style = 'apa')))
```

???
- Data-driven

- Find high freqency paired mass distance relationship between peaks from same compounds

  - reveal unknown adducts/netrual loss
  - find independant peaks

- Find high freqency paired mass distance relationship between peaks from different compounds

  - reveal unknown reactions
  - quantitative analysis for reactions

---

## Plan

- Connection with reaction database

- Quantitive analysis method for biomarker reactions

- More **real data**

- MSSM exposome docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yufree/xcmsrocker/) for reproducible research

---

## Prelimitary Results

```{r echo=F}
pmd <- c(1382,43)
pmdcluster <- c(1382,52)
CAMERA <- c(2043,28)
RAMclust <- c(1149,36)
profinder <- c(3361,39)
comp <- cbind.data.frame(pmd,pmdcluster,CAMERA,RAMclust,profinder)
rownames(comp) <- c('Independant peaks','Target compounds')
knitr::kable(comp, format = 'html')
```

- 117 compounds for validation
- 64 compounds could be found by xcms while 39 could be found by profinder untarget analysis
- pmd could improve peaks selection
