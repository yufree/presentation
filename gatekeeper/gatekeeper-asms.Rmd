## Background

### One compound, one outcome

- regular epidemiology study

### One compound, multiple outcomes

- regular toxicology study

### Multiple compounds, one outcome

- regular metabolomics/non-targeted analysis

### Multiple compounds, multiple outcomes

- exposomics

## Exposures-Metabolites-Disease model

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/EMD.png')
```

- What's the relationship between exposures and metabolites?

- What's the relationship between small molecule and health outcome?

- Which metabolites are the most important?

## Gatekeeper theory for EMD model: active metabolites

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/gkc.png")
```

- Active metabolites will connect to other metabolites

---

## Gatekeeper theory for EMD model: gatekeeper

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/gkc.png")
```

- The small molecule linked both exposures and other small molecule should be the frontier of biological process

- Such molecules may regulate the adverse influences of exposures

## Adolescent girls blood samples

- Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP) 
- 152 girls with data on exposures, health outcomes, and potential confounding variables 
- **Exposures** measured by CDC
  - PFCs (n-PFOS, Sm-PFOS, n-PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA)
  - trace elements (BCD, Cadmium; BMN, Manganese; BPBLead, Lead; BSE, Selenium; THG, Mercury) 
- **Metabolomics** by LC-Q-TOF-MS
  - 18750 (ZHP) and 25937 (RPN) features were found in plasma samples
- **Health outcomes**
  - BMI
  - BMI group
  - age at menarche

## Gatekeeper molecular discovery

### Step 1: Correlation clusters among metabolites

### Step 2: Association between metabolites and exposures

### Step 3: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

### Step 4: Association between gatekeeper and health outcome

---

## Step 0: From metabolomics features to independent peaks

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='55%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/peakcom.png')
```

- Remove redundant peaks by GlobalStd algorithm

- 964 (ZHP) and 1784 (RPN) independent peaks as potential metabolites

.half[
```{r ref2,results = 'asis'}
doi <- c('10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.062')
cat(unlist(rcrossref::cr_cn(dois = doi, format = "text", style = 'apa')))
```
]

---

## Step 1: Correlation clusters among metabolites

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/mmnet.png')
```

- Cutoff for correlation: Spearman’s rho > 0.9
- 62 (ZHP) and 98 (RPN) metabolites correlation network clusters found
- 786 out of 964 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites (ZHP) and 1416 out of 1784 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites (RPN)

---

## Step 2: Association between metabolites and exposures

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='87%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gkupset.png'))
```

---

## Step 3: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gkpnp.png')
```

- 28 (ZHP) and 43 (RPN) peaks connected with other peaks and exposures
- 87 (ZHP) and 137 (RPN) peaks connected with exposures only

---

## Step 3: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gkall2.png')
```

- 5 (ZHP) and 5 (RPN) annotated gatekeepers are associated with exposure
- 2 annotated gatekeepers were associated with multiple environmental exposures

## Conclusion

- Gatekeeper discovery could be used to screen metabolites associated with exposures and other metabolites

- Some gatekeepers are sensitive to multiple environmental exposures

- Gatekeepers can reveal mechanistic aspects of relationships between environmental exposures and metabolome to generate hypothesis for future health related studies

- As a general data analysis framework, the mediation molecular can also be gene, protein, RNA, and/or metagenomics
