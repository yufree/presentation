## Background

### One compound, one outcome

- regular epidemiology study

### One compound, multiple outcomes

- regular toxicology study

### Multiple compounds, one outcome

- regular metabolomics/non-targeted analysis

### Multiple compounds, multiple outcomes

- exposomics

## EMD model

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/EMD.png')
```

- What's the relationship between small molecule and health outcome?

- What's the relationship between exposures and metabolites?

- Which metabolites are the most important?

## Frontier molecular orbital theory

> The frontier molecular orbitals of a compound are at the “frontier” of electron occupation—the highest-energy occupied and lowest-energy unoccupied molecular orbitals (the HOMO and LUMO)

- Active electron is located at the active molecular orbitals

- Not all electrons will be influenced in chemical reactions

- electron could be treated as endogenous compound

- Not all metabolites responded to the stimuli of exposures

---

## Gatekeeper theory for EMD model

- The metabolites linked both exposures and other metabolites should be the frontier of biological process

- Such molecules may regulate the adverse influences of exposures

## Gatekeeper molecular discovery

### Step 1: Correlation among metabolites

### Step 2: Correlation among exposures

### Step 3: Association between paired metabolites and exposures

### Step 4: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

### Step 5: Association between gatekeeper and health outcome

## Adolescent girls blood samples

- BCERP project
- 163 girls with data on exposure, outcome, and potential confounding variables 
- PFCs (n-PFOS, n-PFOA, Sm-PFOS, Sm2-PFOS, PFHXS, PFNA2) and trace elements (BCD, Cadmium; BMN, Manganese; BPBLead, Lead; BSE, Selenium; THG, Mercury)
- Pubertal milestones
- 18750 (ZHP) and 25937 (RPN) features found in blood samples

## Step 0: From featuers to independent peaks

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/gapfc.jpg')
```

.half[
```{r ref1,results = 'asis'}

cat(unlist(rcrossref::cr_cn(dois = doi, format = "text", style = 'apa')))
```
]

---

## Step 0: GlobalStd Algorithm

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://yufree.github.io/presentation/figure/GlobalStd.png')
```

- 964 (ZHP) and 1784 (RPN) independent peaks as potential metabolites

.half[
```{r ref2,results = 'asis'}
doi <- c('10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.062')
cat(unlist(rcrossref::cr_cn(dois = doi, format = "text", style = 'apa')))

## Step 1: Correlation among metabolites

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width= '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/mmnet.png')
```

- Spearman’s rho > 0.9
- 67 (ZHP) and 95 (RPN) metabolites correlation network clusters found
- 787 out of 964 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites (ZHP)
- 1419 out of 1784 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites (RPN)

---

## Step 2: Correlation among exposures

- Spearman’s rho > 0.9
- No correlation could be found among exposures

## Step 3: Association between paired metabolites and exposures

```

- 36 (ZHP) and 47 (RPN) peaks connected with other peaks and exposures
- 163 (ZHP) and 163 (RPN) peaks connected with exposures only

## Step 4: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gkapn.png')
```

- 15 (ZHP) and 11 (RPN) gatekeepers are associated with multiple exposures
- 5 annotated gatekeepers were associated with multiple exposures

## Step 5: Association between gatekeepers and health outcome

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width= '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/MSgk.png')
```

- 4 out of 5 gatekeepers were associated with Pubertal milestones

---

## Conclusion

- Only a small fraction of metabolites have responses to exposures

- Gatekeeper discovery could be used to screen such metabolites

- Some gatekeepers are sensitive to multiple exposures

- Gatekeepers might reveal the details of exposures influences
