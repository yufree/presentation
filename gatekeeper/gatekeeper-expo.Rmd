## Exposures-Metabolites-Disease model

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

- What's the relationship between small molecule and health outcome?

- What's the relationship between exposures and metabolites?

- Which metabolites are the most important?

## Gatekeeper theory for EMD model

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/EMDG.png')
```

- The small molecule linked both exposures and other small molecule should be the frontier of biological process

- Such molecules may regulate the adverse influences of exposures

## Gatekeeper molecular discovery

### Step 1: Correlation among metabolites/exposures

### Step 2: Association between metabolites and exposures

### Step 3: Association between gatekeeper and health outcome

## Step 1: Correlation among metabolites

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/mnec.png')
```

- Cutoff for correlation: Spearmanâ€™s rho > 0.9
- 9 metabolites correlation network clusters found
- 155 out of 177 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites

---

## Step 2: Association between metabolites and exposures

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/menec.png')
```

- 22 peaks connected with other peaks and exposures
- 155 peaks connected with exposures only

---

## Step 2: Association between metabolites and exposures

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/upset.png')
```

---

## Step 3: Association between gatekeeper and health outcome

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gka.png')
```

---

## Conclusion

- Gatekeeper discovery could be used to screen metabolites associated with exposures and other metabolites or battlefront

- Some gatekeepers are sensitive to multiple environmental exposures

- Gatekeepers might reveal mechanistic aspects of relationships between environmental exposures and metabolome to generate hypothesis for future studies

- Gatekeeper can be metabolites, genes, proteins, etc.
