## Last year ...

- Reactomics paper is published on **Commutations Chemistry**

## Background

### One compound, one outcome

- regular epidemiology study

### One compound, multiple outcomes

- regular toxicology study

### Multiple compounds, one outcome

- regular metabolomics/non-targeted analysis

### Multiple compounds, multiple outcomes

- exposomics

---

## Scientific questions

### What's the relationship between small molecule and health outcome?

### What's the relationship between exposures and metabolites?

### Which metabolites are the most important?

---

## EMD model

### One to multiple issue

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/EMD.png')
```

## Frontier molecular orbital theory

> The frontier molecular orbitals of a compound are at the “frontier” of electron occupation—the highest-energy occupied and lowest-energy unoccupied molecular orbitals (the HOMO and LUMO)

- Active electron is located at the active molecular orbitals

- Not all electrons will be influenced in chemical reactions

- electron could be treated as endogenous compound

- Not all metabolites responded to the stimuli of exposures

---

## Gatekeeper theory for EMD model

- The metabolites linked both exposures and other metabolite should be the frontier of biological process

- Such molecules may regulate the adverse influences of exposures

```

## Gatekeeper molecular discovery

### Step 1: Correlation among metabolites

### Step 2: Correlation among exposures

### Step 3: Association between paired metabolites and exposures

### Step 4: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

### Step 5: Association between gatekeeper and health outcome

## Adolescent girls blood samples

- BCERP project
- 180 girls with data on exposure, outcome, and potential confounding variables 
- PFCs (n-PFOS, n-PFOA, Sm-PFOS, Sm2-PFOS, PFHXS, PFNA2) and heavy metals (BCD, Cadmium; BMN, Manganese; BPBLead, Lead; BSE, Selenium; THG, Mercury)
- Pubertal milestones
- 964 (ZHP) and 1784 (RPN) independent peaks as potential metabolites

---

## Step 1: Correlation among metabolites

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/mmnet.png')
```

- Spearman’s rho > 0.9
- 58 (ZHP) and 95 (RPN) metabolites correlation network clusters found
- 802 out of 964 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites (ZHP)
- 1441 out of 1784 metabolites have no correlation with other metabolites (RPN)

---

## Step 2: Correlation among exposures

- Spearman’s rho > 0.9
- No correlation could be found among exposures 

---

## Step 3: Association between paired metabolites and exposures

**PFCs**

## Step 3: Association between paired metabolites and exposures

**Metals**

|-----------|--------|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Single    | 2/3    | 8/1     | 1/0     | 13/0     | 1/1   |
| Double    | 0/0    | 6/3     | 16/0    | 20/0     | 0/1   |
| Triple    | 0/0    | 8/7     | 7/2     | 7/0      | 0/0   |

| Total     | 2/3    | 28/16   | 25/2    | 44/0     | 1/2   |

## Step 3: Association between paired metabolites and exposures

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gkpnp.png')
```

- 45 (ZHP) and 103 (RPN) peaks connected with other peaks and exposures
- 233 (ZHP) and 337 (RPN) peaks connected with exposures only

---

## Step 4: Screen the network structure to discover gatekeeper

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/gkapn.png')
```

- 13 gatekeepers were associated with multiple exposures
---

## Step 5: Association between exposure and health outcome

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width= '61%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/MilestonesStage.png')
```

- Pubertal milestones are associated with multiple exposures

---

## Step 5: Association between gatekeepers and health outcome

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width= '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yufree/presentation/gh-pages/figure/MSgk.png')
```

- 11 out of 13 gatekeepers were associated with Pubertal milestones

---

## Conclusion

- Only a small fraction of metabolites have response to exposures

- Gatekeeper discovery could be used to screen such metabolites

- Gatekeepers are more sensitive to multiple exposures

- Gatekeepers might reveal the details of exposures influences

---

## Reactomics + Gatekeeper

- Correlation and paired mass distances

- Correlation network 

- High frequency paired mass distances network

- Chemical reactions to explain the gatekeepers' function ...
